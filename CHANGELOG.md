# Changelog

## [0.0.1] - 2025-09-23
- Initial Rich logging backbone MVP.
- Added domain model (`LogContext`, `LogEvent`, `LogLevel`, `DumpFormat`, `RingBuffer`) with property-tested invariants.
- Introduced application ports and use cases for processing, dumping, and shutdown orchestration.
- Implemented adapters for Rich console, journald, Windows Event Log, Graylog, dump exporters, queue infrastructure, scrubbing, and rate limiting.
- Exposed public fa√ßade (`init`, `bind`, `get`, `dump`, `shutdown`, `logdemo`) plus diagnostic hooks.
- Console palette overrides via `init(console_styles=...)` and `LOG_CONSOLE_STYLES`; shipped themed previews through `logdemo` and documented palettes in `CONSOLESTYLES.md`.
- Captured `user_name`, short `hostname`, `process_id`, and bounded `process_id_chain` for every event; surfaced the fields across text/JSON/HTML dumps, Rich console, Graylog, journald, and Windows Event Log.
- Added ring buffer configuration knobs (`ring_buffer_size`, `LOG_RING_BUFFER_SIZE`) and dump customisation (`level`, `text_format`, `color`) with matching environment overrides such as `LOG_DUMP_TEXT_FORMAT`.
- Added `LOG_SCRUB_PATTERNS` environment override, merged with per-call scrub patterns.
- Graylog adapter now supports TCP or UDP transport plus optional TLS with validation of incompatible combinations.
- Auto-disable journald on Windows and Windows Event Log on non-Windows hosts to match platform support.
- `logdemo` can now exercise Graylog (`--enable-graylog` with endpoint/protocol/TLS options), systemd-journald (`--enable-journald`), and Windows Event Log (`--enable-eventlog`) from the CLI or API; the helper reports requested sinks via the returned `backends` mapping for quick manual verification.
- Graylog adapter now keeps TCP connections open and transparently reconnects after failures, eliminating new socket churn for every event while still supporting UDP/TLS transports.
- Reorganised documentation: moved install steps to `INSTALL.md`, contributor workflow to `DEVELOPMENT.md`, added `SUBPROCESSES.md`, and expanded README usage guidance.
